**ntast** is a specification for representing [Notion] pages in [syntax
trees][syntax-tree]. It implements the [**unist**][unist] specification. It can
represent different types of pages in Notion: Page, Table, Board, List, and
Calendar.

## Introduction

This document defines a format for representing [Notion] pages as [abstract
syntax trees][syntax-tree]. This specification is written in [Typescript].

### Where this specification fits

ntast extends [unist], a format for syntax trees, to benefit from its [ecosystem
of utilities][utilities].

ntast relates to [JavaScript] in that it has a rich ecosystem of utilities for
working with compliant syntax trees in JavaScript. However, ntast is not limited
to JavaScript and can be used in other programming languages.

ntast relates to the [unified] and [unified]-based projects in that ntast syntax
trees can be used throughout their ecosystems.

### What this specification doesn't do

ntast focuses on content. Notion-application data structures like workspaces,
users, permissions, settings, etc, aren't defined by ntast. Ecosystem plugins
can process and extend functionalities based on these data, though.

## Nodes

### `Node`

```ts
interface Node extends UnistNode {
  type: NtastType;
}
```

**Node** ([**UnistNode**][dfn-unist-node]) represents a node in ntast. It
differentiates a node in ntast with nodes in other [unist]-based specifications.

### `Parent`

```ts
interface Parent extends UnistParent {
  children: Node[];
}
```

**Parent** ([**UnistParent**][dfn-unist-parent]) represents a node in ntast
containing other [nodes](#node) (said to be [children][dfn-unist-child]).

Its content is limited to only ntast nodes.

### `Literal`

```ts
interface Literal extends UnistLiteral {
  value: string;
}
```

**Literal** ([**UnistLiteral**][dfn-unist-literal]) represents a node in ntast
containing a value.

Its `value` is a `string`.

### `Block`

```ts
interface Block extends UnistNode {
  id: UUID;
  title: InlineContent[];
}
```

**Block** ([**UnistNode**][dfn-unist-node]) represents what is famously known as
a "block" in Notion. A block has a unique `id` for references and a `title`.

### `Page`

```ts
interface Page extends Block, Parent {
  type: "page";
}
```

**Page** ([**Block**](#block), [**Parent**](#parent)) represents a page.

**Page** can be used as the [root][dfn-unist-root] of a [tree][dfn-unist-tree]
or a [child][dfn-unist-child] of another [page](#page) (also known as a
subpage).

### `Text`

```ts
interface Text extends Block {
  type: "text";
}
```

**Text** ([**Block**](#block)) represents a text block (title, paragraph, etc)
in Notion.

### `Divider`

```ts
interface Divider extends Block {
  type: "divider";
  title: [];
}
```

**Divider** ([**Block**](#block)) represents divider block in Notion. It has no
content.

### `ToDo`

```ts
interface ToDo extends Block {
  type: "to_do";
  checked: boolean;
}
```

**ToDo** ([**Block**](#block)) represents to-do block in Notion. It has a
`checked` value indicating if it's checked or not.

### `BulletedList`

```ts
interface BulletedList extends Block, Parent {
  type: "bulleted_list";
}
```

**BulletedList** ([**Block**](#block),[**Parent**](#block)) represents bulleted
list block in Notion. It may has children.
