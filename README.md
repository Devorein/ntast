**ntast** is a specification for representing [Notion] pages in [syntax
trees][syntax-tree]. It implements the [**unist**][unist] spec. It can represent
different types of Notion pages: Page, Table, Board, List, Calendar.

## Introduction

This document defines a format for representing [Notion] pages as [abstract
syntax trees][syntax-tree]. This specification is written in [Typescript]
syntax.

### Where this specification fits

ntast extends [unist], a format for syntax trees, to benefit from its [ecosystem
of utilities][utilities].

ntast relates to [JavaScript] in that it has a rich ecosystem of utilities for
working with compliant syntax trees in JavaScript. However, ntast is not limited
to JavaScript and can be used in other programming languages.

ntast relates to the [unified] and unified-based projects in that ntast syntax
trees can be used throughout their ecosystems.

## Nodes

### `Node`

```ts
interface Node extends UnistNode {
  type: NtastTypes;
}
```

**Node** ([**UnistNode**][dfn-unist-node]) represents a node in ntast. It's
defined to differentiate a node in ntast with nodes in other unist-based
specifications.

### `Parent`

```ts
interface Parent extends UnistParent {
  children: Node[];
}
```

**Parent** ([**UnistParent**][dfn-unist-parent]) represents a node in ntast
containing other nodes (said to be [children][dfn-unist-child]).

Its content is limited to only other ntast nodes.

### `Literal`

```ts
interface Literal extends UnistLiteral {
  value: string;
}
```

**Literal** ([**UnistLiteral**][dfn-unist-literal]) represents a node in ntast
containing a value.

Its `value` is a `string`.

### `Block`

```ts
interface Block extends UnistNode {
  id: UUID;
  version: number;
  title: InlineContent[];
}
```

**Block** ([**UnistNode**][dfn-unist-node]) represents a node in ntast
containing a unique `id`, a `version` number, and an inline `title`.

It is what famously known as a "block" in Notion.

### `Page`

```ts
interface Page extends Block, Parent {
  type: "page";
}
```

**Page** ([**Block**](#block), [**Parent**](#parent)) represents a page.

**Page** can be used as the [root][dfn-unist-root] of a [tree][dfn-unist-tree]
or a [child][dfn-unist-child] of another [page](#page) (also known as a
subpage).

### `Text`

```ts
interface Text extends Block {
  contents: InlineContent[];
}
```

**Text** ([**Block**](#block)) represents a paragraph in Notion. It contains
multiple inline contents.
